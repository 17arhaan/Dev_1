<!--
*Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear.

*Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match.

*Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS.

*Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type.
